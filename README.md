# Data-Science-and-ML

This directory contains some useful Data Science tutorials/cheatsheets and Projects that I tackled using different ML algorithms. 

Currently useful projects include the FreeCodeCamps challenges
that can be reached from the following [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/).

It also includes a notebook file that summarize the Kaggle's Pandas [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) on data manupilation. Data files regarding the latter can be reached from the same link.
